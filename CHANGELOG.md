# 1.2.0
*There is alot of content here, I honestly wanted to skip a bunch of versions, but I suspect this will continue having work done so.*
- ### **Dumpsec Support**
	- Added parsing support for dumpsec. Currently, file formats of .txt, .text, .xls, and .xlsx
	- Full Excel and Text (Tab delimited) support.
	- Translates DumpSec output back into relevant AD attributes.
	- Can use the filters that previously exist in ld3p
	- Parses groups so that identical user entries with different groups are merged under the same user with a group list.
	- Added *-np, --no-parse* which will take in the dumpsec data raw and ignore any parsing done on it (mapping to AD values).
		- This will also ignore the dumpsec ignore list, which has paramaters deemed not neccesary, this list can be changed or removed entirely.
- ### New / Modified Filters
	- *-aa --any-admin* : Will filter if the term 'admin' is in any of the groups. Useful with -grl
	- *-lo --locked-out* : Will filter by users who are locked out of their accounts.
	- *-cF --custom-filter* : Filters by splitting the argument "VAR=VAL" looks for all users where VAR == VAL
	- #### Modified Filters
		- *-eu --enabled-users*, *-pe --password-expires*, and *-lo --locked-out* are now based on the next paramater
			- The paramater can be any of (0/1 f/t false/true no/yes n/y)
- ### New / Modified Attributes
	- *-nam* : Returns the `name` attribute of the user
	- *-pls --password-last-set* : Gets when the password is last set
	- *-grl --group-list* : Returns a list of the names of groups that you are in
	- *-cA --custom-attribute* : Returns the string value of a custom attribute
- ### Other New / Modified Paramaters
	- Renamed *--output-file* and *--load-path* to *--output-path* and *--input_path* (respectively)
	- Split *--data-format* into *--input-format* and *--output-format* (self-explainatory)
	- Added *--debug* for those running custom code
	- Added *--dump-loaded* to dump the loaded file, this can be used to translate DumpSec into json similar to ldapdomaindump.py
- ### Refactoring
	- Rewrote several filters to be slightly shorter and cleaner.
		- Cleaned up Memberof filters
		- Used the bitwise and instead of using specific values for useraccontcontrol
- ### Misc
	- Added compatibility metrics in filters / attributes. `[U,C,G,A]` etc
